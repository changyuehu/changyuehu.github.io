I am a second-year a Ph.D. student in [Actuarial Science](https://asrm.illinois.edu) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Zhiyu Quan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhiyufrankquan/). Prior to joining the doctoral program, I obtained a Master’s degree in Actuarial Science at the University of Illinois and a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at Nankai University. My research interests lie in machine learning applications in actuarial science, especially with tree-based models. I have been a graduate supervisor of several InsurTech-related research projects in [IRisk Lab](https://asrm.illinois.edu/illinois-risk-lab/) since Spring 2021. 

Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
