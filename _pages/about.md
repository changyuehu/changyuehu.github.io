I am a 4th-year a Ph.D. student in [Actuarial Science](https://asrm.illinois.edu) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Zhiyu Quan](https://www.zhiyuquan.net). Prior to joining the doctoral program, I obtained a Master’s degree in Actuarial Science at the University of Illinois and a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at Nankai University. My research interests lie in machine learning applications in actuarial science. I have been a graduate supervisor of several InsurTech-related research projects in [IRisk Lab](https://asrm.illinois.edu/illinois-risk-lab/) since Spring 2021.
